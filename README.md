## Hola!

I can code and do art, sometimes at the same time. I love demoscene, graphics programming, procedural generation, making content creation tools and games.

Today I'm at [diegofg.com](http://diegofg.com) and on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/feiss).

In my previous life I used to paint skies and clouds for animated movies: ([feiss.be](http://feiss.be) & [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/feiss))
