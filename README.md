## Hola!

I can code and make art. I love demoscene, graphics programming, procedural generation, making content creation tools and games.

Today I'm at [diegofg.com](http://diegofg.com) and on [Mastodon](https://c.im/@feiss).

In my previous life I used to make illustrations and mattepaintings for animated movies: ([feiss.be](http://feiss.be), [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/feiss))
